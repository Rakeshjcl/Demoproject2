In our demo repository, we modify and add some content to the reset_lifecycle_file.
Invoking git status shows that Git is aware of the changes to the file.
These changes are currently a part of the first tree, "The Working Directory". 
Git status can be used to show changes to the Working Directory. 
They will be displayed in the red with a 'modified' prefix.
